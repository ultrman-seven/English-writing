Good afternoon everyone, today I'd like to talk about movies in Hong Kong in the second half of the last century, which is called the golden age of Hong Kong movies.

HK, this is a city of all colors. Before 1950s, as a result of the influence of the situation, Hong Kong's film industry is in a state of ups and downs, but it also lays the groundwork. The 1950s to the 1970s was a period of rapid film development in Hong Kong. During this period, a film company called Shaw Brothers(邵氏电影) has spread up, it was good at swordsman films and it began to become a major force in Hong Kong's film industry at that time. It produced more than five hundred films in a decade and about 70% are swordsmen films. In this period, the main famous actor is 狄龙. He is the leading actor of most swordsman films.

The golden age was the 70s to the 90s, HK movie industry entered its heyday. In the 1970s, a film company called Golden harvest(嘉禾电影) began to rise and became one of the most influential film companies in Hong Kong's film industry. It has **cultivated** such superstars as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Bruce Lee brought Chinese kung fu culture to the West, which also left a deep imprint on Hong Kong films and created the myth of Hong Kong's film industry.
After Bruce Lee's early death, the Xu brothers pioneered a unique style of comedy and were very popular, which gave birth to the Kong Fu comedy. Many of Jackie Chan's films are Kong Fu comedy movies.
In the late 1970s, the "New Wave" of Hong Kong films emerged, and the theme, type, style and reflection of HK films broke through the traditions of the past, for example, gamble films, crime films, urban films and **Gangster** films began to spring up, turning a new page in Hong Kong films. Some talented directors like 徐克, 吴宇森, 王家卫 and so on are beginning to emerge from this period and they created very influential works in 1980s. The 80's also made many famous and talented actors, for example, 张国荣, 周润发, 周星驰, 梁朝伟 and so on.

Movies in this period have a unique Hong Kong taste. The film is mostly about the story of the little man, the dream of little man, someone is desperate to be rich overnight, someone trust in brotherhood, good and evil have its payoff.

In the last, Hong Kong film is an entertaining and commercial film model, but it does reflect social phenomena, so that you can more or less get some recognition of Hong Kong society in Hong Kong film. Hong Kong films can map certain social phenomena, so if you taste them carefully, you can smell the history of Hong Kong society and gain insight into the history of Hong Kong's film industry.

# answers
1. I think the special history situation and the state of economic development at that time decide the taste of HK movies. you know in HK at that time, there are skyscrapers with colorful neon lights, and under the floor are slums, where people live a gray life. films are mostly about the story of these kind of people, most people.

 From this perspective, HK at that time is a city which looks like magical or a little cyberpunk. So most HK movies describe characters live in this condition

2. It is generally believed that the golden age of Hong Kong films ended after 2003.

3. On the one hand, hong Kong's film industry has declined as a result of the financial turmoil and the shrinking local market, but more importantly, the attitude of filmmakers to make films is the key to the point.HK films doesn't focus on "Hong Kong" but on "film". Once Hong Kong films looked rough, but the overall quality of filmmakers is not bad at all. This comes from the profession and effort of the staff in each position.

4. My favorite movie is Infernal Affairs(无间道). It is a police and gangster film but more than a police and gangster film because the police in it is an undercover gangster and the gangster is an undercover gangster. The gangster longed to be a good man after several years as an undercover policeman but he had no way to choose. Compared with the former police and gangster film, Infernal Affairs let characters beyond the "police and thieves" professional concept for the first time.
